# 📚 GenAI Research Reading List (Foundations → SOTA)

This repository curates **must-read research papers** that define modern Generative AI —
from Transformers and Diffusion to LLM reasoning, scaling laws, and agent systems.

Inspired by an industry-curated GenAI reading list and organized for:
- ML / AI Engineers
- Applied Scientists
- Research Engineers
- Interview & system-design prep

---

Foundational papers every GenAI practitioner must understand.

- Attention Is All You Need (Transformers)
- Backpropagation
- GPT-3 (Few-shot learning & emergence)
- DDPM (Diffusion models)
- CLIP (Multimodal embeddings)

---

## 🧭 Tier 2: Enablers
Key breakthroughs that made GenAI practical and scalable.

- GANs
- Latent Diffusion / Stable Diffusion
- Variational Autoencoders
- ImageNet
- Attention in NMT
- ResNet
- RLHF (ChatGPT)

---

## 🚀 Tier 3: Scaling & SOTA
Modern large-scale and state-of-the-art systems.

- World models & video generation
- GPT-4o (multimodal systems)
- BERT
- RAG
- Scaling laws
- Chinchilla
- LLM reasoning
- LLaMA 3

---

## 🛠 Tier 4: Practitioner Essentials
What working engineers actually use.

- QLoRA
- ReAct
